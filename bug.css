The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not working as intended.  The inner `div` element with the class `inner` should change color upon hovering over the outer `div` element, but it does not. 

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div:hover .inner {
  background-color: lightcoral; 
}

.inner {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

The issue is subtle and might not be immediately obvious to developers less familiar with specificity and the cascading nature of CSS.
